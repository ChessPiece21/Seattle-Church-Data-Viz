# Mapping Seattle's Catholic Churches with Python and R
Geographic visualization of the different churches in the Archdiocese of Seattle.

Seattle-Churches.csv, the dataset imported to the geographic data, was created by me and web-scraped from the Archdiocese of Seattle's [Parish Finder](https://archseattle.org/parish-finder/). You can also find it, and the geovisualization I made, on [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chesspiece99/archdiocese-of-seattle-churches).

The Python package [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) made all this possible.
